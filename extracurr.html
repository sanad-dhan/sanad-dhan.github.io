            <p>I still remember what pulled me into quizzing, the HELP Quiz by Om. I hadn’t planned on attending. That evening, I just wanted to get out of my own head, so I tagged along with Aadarsh and KP. Out of pure FOMO, I sent in my application to IBQC. I didn’t think much would come of it. But then came the team meetings, the late-night discussions, the sheer joy of cracking a good question with seniors who genuinely cared about the club and the craft. When I was made the coordinator, I expected it to be smooth. I’d seen it from the inside, after all. But the first semester was rough. Budget constraints, scheduling issues, last-minute scrambles. But we bounced back. The next semester we pulled off ten quizzes, each one better than the last. IBQC gave me memories I know I’ll carry for years.</p></section>

            <p>What's better than riding your bike at 6am in the winters? I actually learnt cycling pretty late, after my JEE Advanced. My uncle gifted me a cycle when I got into IISER, and that’s when I decided to finally learn. Back in Pune, I used to go on early morning rides with a friend. The roads would be quiet, the air cold, it was a nice way to start the day. Now, cycling is mostly just a way to reach class on time.</p></section>

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>It all started in the middle of a free class. Sweta and KP were up to something, and before I knew it, they handed me a book, or rather, a very specific chapter. They wanted to see my reaction reading smut. Yep, that’s how I got introduced to reading. My first proper read was Digital Fortress by Dan Brown- a KP recommendation. Exploring different genres made me settle to crime, murder mystery and thrillers. I even gave romance a shot but it wasn’t really for me. (And yes, I firmly believe anyone who likes Colleen Hoover is a walking red flag.) </p>
